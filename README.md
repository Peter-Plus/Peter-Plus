👋 Hi, I’m Peter | A Unity Game Developer in Training

🎓 I'm a 2nd-year CS undergraduate from China, passionate about game development and interactive systems.

🎮 I’m currently focusing on:
- Unity 2D/3D development using C#
- Spine animation integration & FSM combat systems
- UI programming and toolchain design (ScriptableObject, Editor Extensions)
- Exploring AI-assisted workflows for game dev

🛠️ I’m building a project-based portfolio to sharpen my engineering and design thinking.
You can check out my current project 👉

💡 I'm actively looking for a remote Unity internship / open-source collaboration this summer. If you are working on an indie game, plugin, or tool and looking for contributors — let's connect!
